Computer Science addresses both human-made and natural information processes such as
communication, control, perception, learning and intelligence. Nowadays, most of the people
miss their urgent medication and medical appointments every year due to the lack of reliable
data and knowledge of different hospitals. So to overcome this we need an application
through which user can fetch each and every details regarding treatment via their digital
devices.

This project aims to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem solving, decisionmaking, communication and to solve time consuming tasks in less time. This project is a
healthcare website system for managing all aspects of medical convenience. This convenient
system of working will take all the major concerns like finding hospitals in different location,
contact details and number of beds available, etc. which helps in smooth functioning of the
system which in turn leads to better consequences and creates a better coordination between
patients and doctors.

This systemâ€Ÿs back-end is constructed using PHP and MySQL to ensure reliable database and
its front-end is designed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and JavaScript to provide userfriendly interface.
